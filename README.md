# Advance-Quiz-Application-65HIBKJS
This project is a Quiz Management System developed as part of my internship at Inno Bytes Services Ltd. as a Full Stack Java Developer. The system allows students to login and signup to take tests, while teachers or examiners have the ability to create, delete, and alter tests.

The system supports MCQ-based tests, providing an interactive platform for students to participate in quizzes.

Features:
Student Side:
Student registration and login system.
Take quizzes created by teachers.
View results and scores after completing a test.
Teacher/Examiner Side:
Create new tests, including questions and options.
Edit and delete existing tests.
View and manage all student results.


Technologies Used:
Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for future integration)
Database: MySQL/SQLite
Authentication: JWT(JSON Web Tokens)


This system simulates a real-world use case of online examination management, making it a great resource for educational platforms. It's built with scalability in mind and follows industry best practices for both front-end and back-end development.
